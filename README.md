# Intelligent-A-star-Puzzle-Solver-Finding-the-Optimal-Solution
The project utilizes the A* search algorithm and heuristics to solve the 7-tile puzzle using the shortest possible path. The solver evaluates all possible moves to provide efficient and reliable optimal solutions.

## 7-tile Puzzle :
The 7-tile puzzle is played on a 3 by 3 grid with 7 tiles labeled with corresponding images and two empty grids.
The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in order and the empty places are at the bottom right.
